-- A server is mainly an event collector and dispatcher. Fundamentally, it
-- consists of the following:
-- - a game state
-- - an event queue, which is filled (in a nonspecific manner) with events
--   generated by the clients
-- - an update method which is called often and empties the queue, dispatching
--   the events stored therein
-- - a means by which RMIs can be propagated to the clients
--   - this implies a set of clients and a broadcast API
